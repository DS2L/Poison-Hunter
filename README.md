# Poison-Hunter: Characterizing Ethereum Address Poisoning Attack
Dataset of benign addresses and sample phishing addresses involved in the Ethereum address poisoning attacks.

## Benign addresses labeled on Etherscan
The `benign_addresses_on_etherscan.txt` contains 1154 popular Ethereum addresses assigned with benign labels on Etherscan.

## Sample phishing transfers and addresses
The `phishing_transfers_sample.csv` contains 150 samples of phishing addresses, the targeted victim addresses, as well as the phishing transfers and targeted benign transfers. Due to ethical concerns, we decide to share only 150 samples. If you need to obtain the rest of the phishing transfers and addresses presented in our paper, please contact us.
